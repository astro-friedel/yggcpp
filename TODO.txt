* Move address away from pointer?
* Re-structure so that top namespace in C++ is YggInterface
* Move C++ interface into src directory
* Automated documentation using doxygen
* Fill in missing docs
* Add RabbitMQ communicator (low priority)
* Add test to verify that send/recv/call/wait can be interuppted by Ctrl+C
* Allow for server/client to dynamically use different base communicators?
* Allow for datatype to be passed as a argument to the constructors in C++ and Python
* Remove uses of C++ exceptions for better compatiblity with fortran (allows use of clang/msvc with gfortran)
* Add cmake/package config files that can be used by other packages
* Expand C & Fortran interfaces for ply/obj to match Python
* Automate fortran wrapping of C interface?
* Change how ply & obj are stored to be generic geometry structure?
* Add method for reserving addresses and generating new addresses if a reserved one is used so that proxy is not needed for every connection
* Refactor so that serialize/deserialize operate on rapidjson::Document and only specialied send/recv calls ApplyVarArgs
* Determine how async should be handled by the C/C++ interface (allow flags to be passed?)
* Add templated methods for sending/receiving multiple variables of different types
* Ensure send/recv of bytes gets passed through serialize/deserialize
